# ![alt text](https://assets.breatheco.de/apis/img/images.php?blob&random&cat=icon&tags=breathecode,32) Contact List REST API in Flask

Creating and maintaining REST APIs is THE everyday job for most of back-end developers, so it is a skill that we need to mature. In this project we'll practice every step of the API development process.

We are going to build the API that manages a contact-list database and publicly expose the endpoints so client applications (including ours) can use it. This time we'll include *Groups*, a new entity that will allow the system to group *Contacts*. Example: Work, Family, Friends. **Hint**: we can implement this logic by using a *many-to-many* relationship between the two tables. 

## üìù Instructions

Create an API with the following endpoints:

1. Get a list of all the Contacts `GET /contact/all`
2. Create a new Contact `POST /contact`
3. Get a specific Contact (with the Group objects it belongs to) `GET /contact/{contact_id}`
4. Delete a Contact `DELETE /contact/{contact_id}`
5. Update a Contact `UPDATE /contact/{contact_id}`
6. Get a list of all the Group names and ids `GET /group/all`
7. Create a new Group `POST /group`
8. Get a specific Group (with all Contact objects related to it) `GET /group/{group_id}`
9. Update a Group name `UPDATE /group/{group_id}`
10. Delete a Group `DELETE /group/{group_id}`

A contact must have the following data-structure on the database:
```python
# Contact
    id: (int, primary_key)
    full_name: (string, mandatory)
    email: (string, mandatory)
    address: (string, optional)
    phone: (string, optional)
    groups: (list of foreign_key)

# Group
    id: (int, primary_key)
    name: (string, mandatory)
    contacts: (list of foreign_key)
```

## üí° How to start?

1. Start by reading the instructions very carefully.
2. Build the database model class Contact and Group.
3. Implement the add methods (POST) to be able to add some contacts and groups into the database to make sure you have dummy data.
4. Create the GET(all) endpoints. List contacts and list groups.
5. Implement the rest of the endpoints.
6. Connect your React Contact List application using `fetch`.
  
Hint: Use Postman as a testing tool before you connect your front end application (React Contact List).
## üìñ Fundamentals
